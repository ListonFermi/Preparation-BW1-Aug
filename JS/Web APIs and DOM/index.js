// Event Propagation: How events move through the DOM, including both capturing (downward) and bubbling (upward) phases.
// Event Capturing: Events are handled as they move down the DOM tree towards the target element.
// Event Bubbling: Events are handled as they bubble up from the target element to the root of the DOM.
// Event Delegation: A technique where a single event listener on a parent element can manage events for all its child elements, taking advantage of event bubbling.
